  <h1 class="intro-title">Introduction</h1>
  <p class="intro-text">Hi, I'm Michael. I'm a web developer-kind of, and currently work for <span class="colortext">JDA Software</span> in Scottsdale, AZ. I started in marketing, but quickly worked my way into more technical roles. I used to work strictly with emails, but now I'm trying to master a lot more about web design and development.<br /><br />

    <span class="bolded">I love technology</span> and enjoy being on the development and production side of things compared to where I started. If only I was aware of all of this when I started college...

  <h1 class="intro-title">Where I'm From</h1>
  <p class="intro-text">Born and raised in <span class="bolded">Arizona</span>. I now own a house, live, and work all within a 10 mile radius from where I grew up. I really ventured far in life, right? Phoenix/Scottsdale has always been my home and I love it here.<br /><br />

    I went to college at <span class="colortext">Northern Arizona University</span> which is in a smaller mountain town about 2 hours north, but thats as far as I ever got. It was a great place to spend 4 years, but I was always driving back to visit friends, family, and just enjoy the benefits of a big city.

  <h1 class="intro-title">More About Me</h1>
  <h2>What are your favorite hobbies?</h2><p class="intro-text">
I'm the most active couch potato you'll ever meet. I love doing Crossfit, playing ultimate frisbee, hiking, yoga, and all sorts of activity. Yet, in my downtime I love gaming (xbox and the PC master race) and catching up on my favorite TV series.</p>

    <h2>What is your dream job?</h2><p class="intro-text">
I'd love to expand my skillset and continue to be [a more skilled] web developer, getting involved with bigger and more intensive projects. Working with marketing teams and helping build and create solutions for them is great. I love the line of work and am always interested in working on cool and exciting subject matter.</p>

    <h2>What is your background?</h2><p class="intro-text">
I've always been interested in graphic design, but majored in advertising when I went to college. I had some internships as a designer but landed my first job right out of school as an account coordinator at an ad agency. From there I just sort fo fell into email specific roles and tought myself what I needed to know in order to design, build, and deploy emails.</p>

    <h2>What music have you been listening too lately?</h2><p class="intro-text">
I'm a huge EDM/house music fan. At the expense of sounding quite 'hipster-ish', I happened upon it early in highschool before it really blew up into the huge scene it is today. I'm really happy it's gotten big though, it puts more music out there and more fun festivals on the calendar!
